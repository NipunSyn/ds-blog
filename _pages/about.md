About me, I'm Nipun Tewari, currently working as an ML Engineer in one of India's fastest growing fintech startups. I graduated from Birla Institute of Technology and Science in 2022 with a major in Civil Engineering and a minor in Data Science. I started my journey in data science in 2020 when the entire country was under lockdown and all the colleges were shut. So, just like everyone else, I also thought it would be a good idea to learn something new, and now I'm here xD

In my free time, I love reading books especially non-fiction. I was a member of my school, as well as my college football team and never miss a chance to hit the field whenever I get one, and I support Manchester United in the English Premier League. From music, TV series, anime, you can hit me up for anything for a chat. And oh, I also love playing the guitar xD
